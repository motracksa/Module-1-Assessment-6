            <p>The concept is based on the elimination of pathogens being ingested by animals,
either from water sources or from contaminated litter or food by the inclusion of
a highly effective micro-biocide in the drinking water. The residual FAC value as
the water enters the host should be sufficient to kill pathogens in the oral cavity,
oesophagus, stomach and upper parts of the small intestine every time the animal
drinks water. The threshold value of FAC in the drinking water has been determined
as 15-20 ppm in a number of trials in various species of animals. Increasing the
value above these levels is not advised as it may influence the taste of the water and
possibly exert a negative effect on normal gut flora.
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), contained in the anolyte or oxidant fraction in the
process of Electro-Chemical Activation (ECA) of water is a proven compound. Trials
conducted in several countries have indicated the benefits</p>
